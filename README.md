# LOOP
- This project involved creating a platform that provides detailed information about movies. 
- It covers the latest releases and trending titles. 
- The platform has a clean and easy-to-use design made with ReactJS and TailwindCSS. - It gives up-to-date information on new and upcoming movies. 
- I used Redux for efficient state management. 
- User authentication and authorization were added for security. Firebase was used for both authentication and deploying the platform.
- TMDB APIs are used to fetch details of the movies.
